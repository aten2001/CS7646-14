## Write a program to sort a list of numbers provided on standard input
# (for instance, the numbers you generated above). You are NOT allowed
# to call external routines to do the sorting for you. After sorting
# the numbers, print them out. Focus on a simple method (not an
# efficient method).

def mergeSort(list_of_nums):
    
    sortedList = [0]*len(list_of_nums)
    return sortedList
